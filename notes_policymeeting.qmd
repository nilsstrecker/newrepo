## Possible Policies

-   Mietpreisbremse (rent cap)

-   BÃ¼rgergeld (welfare payments)

-   Mindestlohn (minimum wage)

-   Erbschaftsteuer (inheritance tax)

-   Grundrente (pension subsidy)

-   Wohngeld Plus (housing payments)

-   Laws, that failed to be passed in time, e.g.

    -   Abgeltungsteuer (capital income tax)

    -   Company Sanctions

-   Lieferkettengesetz (supply chain law)

## Lessons learned from pilot

-   Very little information about pre-parliamentary process

-   Just a few very important persons

    -   Ministers

    -   Council members or even speakers

-   Decisions are typically made in private, not even in (closed) council meetings

-   Details about specific events are often hard to come by, very dependent on memory of involved persons --\> Time is of the essence

-   Could be advantageous to have only a few important events

-   Important council members are often personally involved in issues, no \"need\" for outside forces to influence them
